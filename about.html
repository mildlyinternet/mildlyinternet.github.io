    <p>About me:</p>

    <p>I like tea, Vim, donuts and comfortable slippers.</p>

    <p>
      Currently in Seattle, WA. Fun Facts: I used to be tan, used to swim, not
      very good with a camera, and I think Blade Runner is over-rated (come at
      me nerds).
    </p>

    <p>
      A few of the things that I like to talk about - Ruby, Golang, Deployment,
      Vim, Developer Workflow, & Web Design.
