Recently decided to drive up the Oregon coast as part of a longer road trip from 
Tahoe to Seattle. Encountered some beautiful rain and fog that made for a
surreal driving experience.

Wait out the rain with a cup of coffee at [Siuslaw River Coffee
Roasters](http://www.coffeeoregon.com/) in Florence, Oregon.

It's worth stopping at [Local Ocean Seafood](http://www.localocean.net/) for the
Crab Po' Boy. Bread and crab melt in your mouth.
