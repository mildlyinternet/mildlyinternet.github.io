title: How Expensive Are Your Meetings?
category: business

I think too few people realize how much money and productivity their meetings
drain. A one hour meeting with eight people is eight hours of lost work time - a
full day of one employee's time.

Does a meeting usually warrant such a trade off? One hour of meeting for eight
hours of work? 

Meetings have a tendency to:

  * Go off topic quickly.
  * Waste time finding the right words / waiting for a turn to speak.
  * They transmit information at an incredibly inefficient pace.
  * Rarely deal with real things. They are about words and speaking, not action.
  * Fill the full amount of time they were scheduled for - even if it's double
    what is required.

Before you reach for the scheduling or calendar software, think - can this
meeting just be an email?
