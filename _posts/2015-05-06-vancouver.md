description: "Pictures of my Vancouver Road Trip"

Recently I took a short trip out to Vancouver, Canada. Saw the Canucks beat on
the Maple Leafs. Wish I had taken a few more pictures. Overall, I enjoyed my
brief stay. Next time I visit I'll hopefully get the chance to put together a
list of must see / do activities.
